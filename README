. History .
This project started to aid my scout group website (www.agrupamento523.com).
Letting people upload their photo galleries through picasa was way easier
than any other process at the time. Doing the processing on client-side
wasn't necessary since we could do it in the PHP backend, but why not do
something more generic that could be used to embedd galleries onto blogs or
someplace where people can only put their HTML, CSS and JavaScript code?..

And so PicasaFetch was born.

. Next steps .
Refactor code to make it more generic. Let the lightbox stuff be
configurable. Make the language stuff more organized. Turn the function into
a jQuery plugin. Use jQuery.data instead of polluting the global namespace.
Customizable integration with lazyload plugins. *Your suggestion here*.
